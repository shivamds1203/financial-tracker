# 🧾 STEP 2 — RESUME BULLET POINTS (VERY IMPORTANT)

Use **ANY 2–3** of these:

- Designed and developed a **full-stack finance tracking platform** using **React and FastAPI** with JWT-based authentication.
- Implemented **secure protected routes** and role-based access using **token-based authorization**.
- Built RESTful APIs with **FastAPI & SQLAlchemy**, ensuring modular and scalable backend architecture.
- Integrated real-time expense analytics using **Recharts** for improved financial insights.
- Followed production-grade practices including password hashing, API security, and clean project structure.

👉 These bullets are **MS + JOB SAFE**.

# ⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT (HONEST ADVICE)
Do **NOT** upload everything in one day.

Best GitHub strategy:
- Day 1 → Backend + JWT  
- Day 2 → UI + Dashboard  
- Day 3 → Docker  
- Day 4 → AI  

This makes your profile look **real, active, and credible**.
